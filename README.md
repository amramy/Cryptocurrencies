# Cryptocurrencies


## Overview: 

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked for a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data needs to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output unsupervised learning will be used. The data will need to be preprocessing for PCA (Principal Component Analysis), reduce the data dimensions using PCA, clustering the Cryptocurrencies using K-means then visualizing the cryptocurrencies results.
